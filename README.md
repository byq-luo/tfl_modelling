# tfl_modelling

Imperial College London 3rd Year project for finding relationships between rainfall and traffic speed. 
I use data from a psql backend database to fit models to the data. This is done per road, per road nature. 
I have included some graphs to demonstrate some of the results we achieved, and included all the json result files.
I also created a GUI to visualise data from the database to aid me in predicting a model for the relationship.
